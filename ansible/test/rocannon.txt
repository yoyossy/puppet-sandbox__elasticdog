An ansible is a fictitious machine capable of instantaneous or superluminal
communication. Typically it is depicted as a lunch-box sized object with some
combination of microphone, speaker, keyboard and display. It can send and
receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance
whatsoever with no delay. Ansibles occur as plot devices in science fiction
literature.
