NAME
----
ansible-pull - set up a remote copy of ansible on each managed node


SYNOPSIS
--------
ansible -d DEST -U URL [ -C CHECKOUT ]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*Ansible* is an extra-simple tool/framework/API for doing \'remote things' over
SSH.

Use ansible-pull to set up a remote copy of ansible on each managed
node, each set to run via cron and update playbook source via
git. This inverts the default *push* architecture of ansible into a
*pull* architecture, which has near-limitless scaling potential.

The setup playbook can be tuned to change the cron frequency, logging
locations, and parameters to ansible-pull.

This is useful both for extreme scale-out as well as periodic
remediation. Usage of the 'fetch' module to retrieve logs from
ansible-pull runs would be an excellent way to gather and analyze
remote logs from ansible-pull.
