Notice that you need the NSClient++ .msi package which is available here:
http://files.nsclient.org/x-0.4.x/NSCP-0.4.1.62-x64.msi

Modules for Windows can't use normal Puppet URL on Package source attribute. So you need to have the .msi package on your local network.

Check this site if you need more information on NSClient++:
