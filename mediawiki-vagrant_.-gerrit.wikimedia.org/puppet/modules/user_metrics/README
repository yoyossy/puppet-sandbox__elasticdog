User Metrics API Puppet Module
------------------------------

This Puppet module configures a development instance of the User Metrics API.
See <https://metrics.wikimedia.org> for more information about the User Metrics
API.

This module is not enabled by default. To enable it, uncomment the following
line in puppet/manifests/extras.pp:

  # class { 'user_metrics': }

Then run 'vagrant provision'. That should set up a User Metrics API WSGI app
using the Flask framework and Apache as HTTP server. It will be accessible at
http://10.11.12.13:8121. You may wish to forward this port so that it is
accessible from the host environment. See the examples in the file
'Vagrantfile' in the repository root directory.
