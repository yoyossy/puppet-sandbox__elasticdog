  # All Vagrant configuration is done here. The most common configuration

  # The url from where the 'config.vm.box' box will be fetched if it
  # doesn't already exist on the user's system.
#  config.vm.box_url = "http://vntx-box.s3.amazonaws.com/centos6.box"

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
###  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network :public_network

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  # config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    # Don't boot with headless mode
    vb.gui = false
  #
  #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
  #   vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Enable provisioning with Puppet stand alone.  Puppet manifests
  # are contained in a directory path relative to this Vagrantfile.
  # You will need to create the manifests directory and a manifest in
  # the file base.pp in the manifests_path directory.
  #

  # first, get puppet on there
  config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "centos6.sh"
  # second, get openvp on there
  config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "centos6_openvpn.sh"

  # then hand over to puppet to do the rest
  config.vm.provision :puppet do |puppet|
    puppet.manifests_path = "puppet/manifests"
    puppet.manifest_file  = "bootstrap.pp"
    puppet.module_path    = "puppet/modules"
    puppet.options        = "--hiera_config /vagrant/hiera.yaml"
  end
